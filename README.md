# New-Gobang-super-fun

Gomoku is a strategy-based board game for two players. It is easy to operate, easy to use, and suitable for both young and old. The two sides play chess, one relaxes, defends against offensives, strengthens thinking, and can also cultivate one's morals while enjoying leisure and entertainment.
Both sides fall alternately, and now the party that forms the five-pronged connection on the board wins.
